      <!-- <p>I was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota from refugee parents who relocated from southeast Asia. I've lived in Minnesota pretty much my whole life, beside the two years that I spent at New York University in New York. I grew up in a pretty big family, six sisters and no brothers. I am an avid sports fan, specifically Basketball and Football.</p> -->

      <p>I am seeking a new fulfillment/challenge. I have always been interested in coding and have recently decided to commit to growing that skill, thus my enrollment in the University of Minnesota Coding BootCamp has established that needed foundation.
        I believe one should always continue to improve, no matter where they are in their career. I currently work full-time as a Lead Robotics Technician for Jones Lang Lasalle for Amazon Robotics in Shakopee, MN.
        These two commitments, show my desire to improve myself(perhaps a bit too much? definitely feeling the grind) but i know that balancing time/making time is an essential skill to accomplishing any goals/tasks.</p>
      
      <p></p>

      <p>A skill that I pride myself in is the ability to lead. I currently oversee fleet technical operations of 5000+ Amazon Robotic drive units and lead six robotics technicians at MSP1 Amazon Fulfillment Center.</p>
